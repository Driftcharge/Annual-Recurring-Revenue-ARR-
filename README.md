**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** is the predictable yearly income a business earns from active subscriptions.  
It’s one of the most important metrics for SaaS and ecommerce companies, helping brands measure consistent growth, customer retention, and revenue stability.

### 📊 What Is ARR?
ARR shows how much recurring revenue your business can expect each year from ongoing subscriptions — excluding one-time purchases, setup fees, or other non-recurring income.

---

### 🧮 Formula

**ARR = Total Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) × 12**

Or for annual plans:

**ARR = Number of Active Customers × Average Annual Subscription Price**

---

### 💡 Example

If you have 500 subscribers paying $20 per month:  
**ARR = 500 × $20 × 12 = $120,000**

This means your business is projected to earn $120,000 annually from active subscriptions, assuming no churn or upgrades.
